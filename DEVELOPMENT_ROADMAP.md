## ðŸ“‹ IMPLEMENTATION NOTES

### Current Architecture Analysis
- **GUI Framework:** PySide6/Qt
- **Profile System:** Python files in `/interpreter/terminal_interface/profiles/defaults/`
- **Model Management:** Service-based architecture with ModelManager
- **Chat System:** Threaded with worker patterns
- **Settings:** JSON-based configuration

### Key Files to Modify/Create
- `gui/desktop/agent_builder_dialog.py` (NEW)
- `gui/desktop/services/agent_manager.py` (NEW)

- `gui/desktop/services/prompt_library.py` (NEW)
- `gui/desktop/services/rag_manager.py` (ENHANCE EXISTING)
- `gui/desktop/main_window.py` (MODIFY)
- `gui/desktop/settings_dialog.py` (ENHANCE)

### Dependencies to Consider
- `mem0-ai` for memory integration
- Additional vector database libraries for RAG
- UI component libraries for enhanced widgets
- File format parsers for document ingestion

### Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for all new service classes
- Integration tests for agent creation workflow
- UI tests for dialog interactions
- Performance tests for large document sets
