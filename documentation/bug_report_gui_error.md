# Bug Report: GUI AttributeError in chat_window.py

## Describe the bug
The Colonel GUI crashes with an `AttributeError: 'str' object has no attribute 'get'` in `gui/desktop/chat_window.py`'s `append_output` method. This occurs because the `append_output` method expects a dictionary with 'content' and 'type' keys, but it is sometimes receiving a plain string.

Additionally, the application icon and system tray icon are not displaying correctly, even after attempting to set them with both PNG and SVG files.

## Reproduce
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install dependencies using Poetry: `poetry install`
3. Run the GUI: `poetry run colonel-gui`
4. The GUI launches, but then crashes with the `AttributeError`. The application and system tray icons are also not visible.

## Expected behavior
The GUI should launch and function without crashing, and the `append_output` method should correctly handle all types of chunks it receives, or only receive dictionaries as intended. The application and system tray icons should display correctly.

## Screenshots
(Not applicable for this bug, as it's a crash before interaction)

## Open Interpreter version
0.4.3 (The Colonel)

## Python version
3.12.3

## Operating System name and version
Linux

## Additional context
This bug was encountered during the initial setup and launch of the GUI after addressing previous `ImportError` issues. The `InterpreterWorker` is designed to emit dictionaries, and direct calls to `append_output` from `main_window.py` now pass dictionaries. However, the `AttributeError` persists, indicating that string chunks are still being passed to `append_output`. Further investigation suggests that the `_streaming_chat` method in `interpreter/core/core.py` might be yielding string chunks directly, which are then passed through `InterpreterWorker` without being wrapped in a dictionary, leading to the crash. This needs to be addressed at the source of the `yield` in `interpreter/core/core.py` or `interpreter/core/respond.py`.

The icon issue persists despite verifying file paths and attempting both PNG and SVG formats. This might be related to how PySide6 handles icon loading on the specific Linux environment or a conflict with the current styling.

**Update (July 1, 2025):**
GUI modernization efforts have begun, including the implementation of feature toggles, tooltips for various UI elements (menus, buttons, input fields), and attempts to refine the visual design (typography, button aesthetics, layout spacing). However, the core `AttributeError` causing the GUI to crash remains unresolved, preventing full visual confirmation of these changes. The icon display issue also persists.
