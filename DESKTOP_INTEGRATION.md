gtk-update-icon-cache ~/.local/share/icons
```

```bash
# Manually update desktop database
update-desktop-database ~/.local/share/applications
```

# Ensure scripts are executable
chmod +x *.sh
```

### Environment Issues
The launcher script automatically:
- Detects and activates Python virtual environments
- Uses Poetry if available
- Falls back to system Python
