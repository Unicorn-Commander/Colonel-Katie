## [Unreleased]

### Added
- **Memory System:**
    - Implemented a flexible memory system with `BaseMemoryBackend` interface.
    - Added `SQLiteChromaBackend` for structured and semantic memory (using SQLite and custom vector store).
    - Added `PostgreSQL/Qdrant Backend`: Developed `PostgresQdrantBackend` for scalable structured and semantic memory, integrating with PostgreSQL and Qdrant.
    - Integrated `MemoryManager` into `OpenInterpreter` for persistent, adaptive memory.
    - Implemented basic LLM-driven memory extraction in `Llm.extract_memories`.
- **Graphical User Interface (GUI):**
    - Developed a new modular desktop GUI (`gui/desktop`) with a three-column layout.
    - Implemented modern, Unicorn Commander-themed styling.
    - Added conversation history loading and display.
    - Developed a functional right sidebar with session details and collapsible categories.
    - Enhanced chat window with `markdown-it-py` and `Pygments` for robust markdown and code block rendering.
    - Implemented a GUI trigger for file indexing in the right sidebar.
- **File Indexing:**
    - Implemented a custom file indexing and embedding system (`FileIndexer`).
    - Integrated `FileIndexer` into `OpenInterpreter` for project-aware context.
- **Roadmap Updates:**
    - Added "Web GUI Development" to the future roadmap.

### Changed
- `sentence-transformers` is now a core dependency.
- `numpy` compatibility addressed by replacing `chromadb` with a custom SQLite vector store.
- `profiles_dialog.py` updated to correctly reference `chat_window.output_display`.
- `interpreter/core/core.py` updated for robust conversation saving and memory extraction logic.
- Moved `kde_tools` directory into `interpreter/kde_tools` for proper package structure.
- Refactored `interpreter/api/server.py` to integrate server logic (from `async_core.py`) and use the `Server` class.
- Modified `interpreter/core/computer/computer.py` to use absolute imports for `interpreter.kde_tools.wrappers`.
- Refactored `interpreter/__init__.py` to remove direct `OpenInterpreter` instantiation and `--os` logic, resolving circular imports.

### Fixed
- `AttributeError: 'ColonelKDEApp' object has no attribute 'output_display'` in `profiles_dialog.py`.
- `NameError: name 'QLabel' is not defined` in `main_window.py`.
- Resolved `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'interpreter.kde_tools'` by moving `kde_tools` into `interpreter/`.
- Resolved `ImportError: cannot import name 'QVariant' from 'PySide6.QtCore'` by removing `QVariant` import from `kde_tools` modules.
- Resolved `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'inquirer'` by ensuring `uvicorn` runs in the correct virtual environment.
- Resolved `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'sentence_transformers'` by installing the package.
- Resolved `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'psycopg2'` by installing `psycopg2-binary`.
- Resolved `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'qdrant_client'` by installing the package.
- Resolved `ImportError: cannot import name 'interpreter' from partially initialized module 'interpreter'` by refactoring `interpreter/__init__.py` and decoupling `async_core.py`.

## [2.0.1] - 2025-07-01 - Critical Server Fixes

### Fixed - Circular Import Resolution
- **Circular Import in computer.py**: Fixed absolute import `from interpreter.kde_tools.wrappers` to use relative import `from ...kde_tools.wrappers`
- **Circular Import in file_indexing**: Removed unnecessary `from interpreter import interpreter` import causing circular dependency
- **Missing get_storage_path import**: Added proper import for `get_storage_path` from terminal interface utils in core.py
- **Initialization Order Issue**: Fixed FileIndexer initialization to occur after conversation_history_path is set in OpenInterpreter constructor
- **Missing Import Path**: Fixed lazy_import path from `.utils.lazy_import` to `..core.utils.lazy_import` in server.py
- **Missing Return Statement**: Added `return app` at the end of create_colonel_katie_server function
- **Empty async_core.py**: Deleted problematic empty file that was causing circular import issues

### Added - Dependency Management
- **Required Dependencies**: Added installation instructions for `sentence_transformers`, `psycopg2-binary`, `qdrant-client`, `fastapi`, `uvicorn`, `python-multipart`
- **Platform Support**: Added `platformdirs` dependency for cross-platform storage path management

### Changed - Server Architecture
- **Server Function**: create_colonel_katie_server now properly returns FastAPI app instance
- **Import Structure**: Cleaned up import paths to prevent circular dependencies
- **Initialization Logic**: Reorganized OpenInterpreter initialization order for proper dependency resolution

### Verified - Server Functionality âœ…
- **Server Startup**: FastAPI server now starts successfully on port 8000
- **API Endpoints**: OpenAPI specification endpoint responding correctly (HTTP 200)
- **Import Resolution**: All modules import successfully without circular dependency errors
- **Error Handling**: Robust error handling maintained throughout fix process

### Removed
- `AsyncInterpreter` class and server-related logic from `interpreter/core/async_core.py` (file is now empty).
