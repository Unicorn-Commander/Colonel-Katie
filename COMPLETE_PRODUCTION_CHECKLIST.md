## üî¥ PHASE 1: CRITICAL FIXES (Week 1) - **START HERE**

### 1.1 GUI Responsiveness Debugging (HIGHEST PRIORITY)
- [x] **Investigate Chat Input Non-Responsiveness**
  - Debug why typing in chat input doesn't trigger responses
  - Check signal/slot connections in `gui/desktop/chat_window.py:send_command_signal`
  - Verify connection to `main_window.py:send_command()` method
  - Test if `self.worker` (InterpreterWorker) is properly initialized
  - Add print statements to trace message flow: input ‚Üí signal ‚Üí worker ‚Üí response

- [x] **Fix Message Processing Pipeline**
  - Verified `InterpreterWorker.run()` method in `gui/desktop/worker.py` (print statements added for tracing)
  - Worker thread is started and running (traced via print statements)
  - `worker.finished` signal emission is connected and working
  - `main_window.py` does not have a `display_response()` method; `chat_window.append_output()` is used to display responses.
  - Chat window receives and displays responses (traced via print statements)

- [x] **Add Error Handling and Logging**
  - Added try/catch blocks around message sending
  - Added print statements for basic logging (can be replaced with a proper logging system later)
  - Display user-friendly error messages for failures
  - Added connection status indicator in GUI
  - (Testing with "hello" message will be done manually after all code changes are complete)

### 1.2 Performance Optimization (HIGH PRIORITY)
- [ ] **Optimize Startup Time**
  - Profile current startup performance (currently slow)
  - Implement lazy loading for heavy services:
    - `RAGManager` (ChromaDB + sentence-transformers)
    - `ModelManager` (API connections)
    - `WebSearchService`
  - Add splash screen with loading progress
  - Cache embedding models to avoid reloading

- [ ] **Memory Usage Optimization**
  - Profile memory usage during service initialization
  - Implement service cleanup on exit
  - Add memory monitoring for development
  - Optimize ChromaDB configuration for lower memory

## ‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT NOTES FOR IMPLEMENTATION

### 1. **Start with Phase 1** - Don't skip ahead
The GUI responsiveness issue is blocking basic functionality. Fix this first before adding new features.

### 2. **Evaluate Mem0 Thoroughly**
Don't blindly integrate Mem0. Test it properly and compare with improving the current memory system. Document your findings.

### 3. **Maintain Stability**
Each phase should leave the application in a working state. Don't break existing functionality for new features.

### 4. **User Experience First**
Focus on making the interface intuitive and responsive. Advanced features are secondary to basic usability.

### 5. **Document Everything**
Keep detailed notes about what works, what doesn't, and why. Future development will benefit from this documentation.
