```

### Integration Points
- **Main Window:** Add model selector to header, integrate search results
- **Right Sidebar:** Connect all panels to their respective services
- **Chat Window:** Add model switching, function calling UI
- **Settings Dialog:** Replace simple form with tabbed interface

### Service Connection Pattern
```python
# Example: Connecting WebSearchService to Search Panel
from ..services.web_search import WebSearchService

class SearchPanel(QWidget):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        self.search_service = WebSearchService()
        self.setup_ui()
        
    def perform_search(self, query):
        results = self.search_service.search(query)
        self.display_results(results)
```

### Testing Requirements
- [ ] Test each service integration individually
- [ ] Verify error handling for network failures
- [ ] Test with large documents and search results
- [ ] Validate settings persistence across sessions
- [ ] Test model switching during active conversations

**Priority Order:** Work through Priority 1 first (service integration), then Priority 2 (missing UI), then remaining priorities based on user needs.

**Estimated Completion:** 
- Priority 1: ~4-6 hours
- Priority 2: ~8-12 hours  
- Priority 3-4: ~6-8 hours
- Priority 5-6: ~4-6 hours

**Total: ~22-32 hours for complete feature parity and polish**
